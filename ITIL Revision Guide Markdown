# 3 ITIL Guiding Principles - Part One
## 3.1 Introduction to Guiding Principles
**What are the ITIL Guiding Principles**
- Recommendations from best practices
- Applicable to any organization adopting service management
- They are universal and enduring
- They interact and depend on each other
**Seven ITIL Guiding Principles**
[[#3.2 Focus on the Value]]
[[#3.3 Start Where You Are]]
[[#3.4 Progress Iteratively with Feedback]]
[[#4.1 Collaborating an Promoting Visibility]]
[[#4.2 Thinking and Working Holistically]]
[[#4.3 Keeping It Simple and Practical]]
[[#4.4 Optimizing and Automating]]

## 3.2 Focus on the Value
**Focus on the Value**
- Every service should be designed with a focus on providing value
- Value should be addressed to the consumer but not just them
- Value may come in different forms
- Essential to now and understand the customer
- Value is defined by customer needs
**Understanding Out Customers**
- Why do they use out service
- How are the services useful for them
- How critical are the services for them
- What happens if the service is unavailable
**Customer Experience (CX)**
- Represents determining the component of value
- Results form their interactions and experiences with out org
- Bad CX has various causes
- Subjective and objective
- Difficult to measure
- Increasingly important
## 3.3 Start Where You Are
**Start Where You Are**
- Start where you currently are rather than start from scratch
**Measurement is Key**
- Measures are key to :
	- What works and what doesn't
	- Reuse whenever possible
	- Avoid throwing away existing assets
- Measurements may change and influence behaviors
**Important Points On Measurement**
- Do not measure everything just because you can
- Focus on measurements around business outcomes
- Report only relevant results to the customers
- Use a balanced set of metrics
- Keep measurements up to date and relevant
## 3.4 Progress Iteratively with Feedback
**Advantage of an Iterative Approach**
- Complex tasks can be much easier accomplished
- Should not attempt to do everything at once
- Smaller sections of a complex problems can be easier to manage
- Have more chances of delivering in time
- Detailed design will emerge as we progress
**Traditional Approach vs Iterative (Agile) Approach**
- Traditional
	- Linear
	- Scope is known from beginning
	- Customer presence not strictly required
	- Tends to deliver outdated outputs
	- Very limited time flexibility for new requirements
- Iterative/Agile
	- Iterative, team based
	- Works on time-boxes way
	- Relies on feedback loops
	- Increases speed and flexibility
	- Improves quality by early correction
**Importance of Feedback Loops
- Context may change during iteration
- New priorities may appear and integration has to be removed or altered
- Feedback loops may be used here
- Part of the output of an activity is used for new input
